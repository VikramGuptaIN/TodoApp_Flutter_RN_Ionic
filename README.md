# Cross platform comparison
I carried out an analysis of mobile cross platform frameworks.
Based on popularity within the developer community, adoption and technology behind them I picked out the most promising frameworks (Flutter, React-Native,  and Ionic). 

I made a small implementation of a todo application for each framework. This is based on articles, documentation and my own experience as well as any other information i found relevant.

## Getting Started - Flutter 
```
cd ./flutter-todo
flutter build apk
flutter run
```
## Getting Started - React native
```
cd ./react-native-todo
npm install 
```
For android: ```react-native run-android``` <br/>
For ios:   ```react-native run-ios```

 ## Getting Started - Ionic
```
cd ./ionic-todo
npm install
npm run start
```
